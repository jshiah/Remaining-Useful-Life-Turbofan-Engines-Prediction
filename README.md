1. Background
The project addresses the challenge of predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines, a critical factor in both commercial and military aviation, to the highest efficiency. While RUL prediction has been explored in previous research, this project introduces an adaptive sliding window approach to better capture degradation patterns under varying operating conditions, improving prediction accuracy, safety, reliability, and overall sustainability.
